# CL837 BLE Accelerometer Monitor Dependencies
# Real-time monitoring and visualization for CL837 Chileaf protocol accelerometer

# BLE Communication
bleak>=0.21.0              # Cross-platform Bluetooth Low Energy library

# Data Visualization  
matplotlib>=3.7.0          # Plotting and real-time oscilloscope visualization
numpy>=1.24.0              # Numerical computing for data processing

# Note: Standard library modules (no installation required):
# - asyncio          # Async/await support for BLE operations
# - struct           # Binary data parsing (Chileaf protocol)
# - time             # Timing and frequency calculations  
# - threading        # Oscilloscope thread management
# - collections      # Deque for efficient data buffering
# - datetime         # Timestamp handling
# - traceback        # Error debugging

# Optional: Development and testing dependencies
# pytest>=7.0.0            # Unit testing framework
# black>=23.0.0            # Code formatting
# flake8>=6.0.0            # Code linting

# Platform-specific notes:
# Windows: Requires Windows 10 version 1903+ for reliable BLE support
# Linux: May require bluez-tools and python3-dev packages
# macOS: Requires macOS 10.15+ for Core Bluetooth support
